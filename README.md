# Image Segmentation with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for performing image segmentation using OpenCV. Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that partitions an image into meaningful segments to simplify its representation or make it more meaningful for analysis.

## Code Overview

The script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform the following tasks:

1. Read an input image from a file.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Apply a binary threshold to create a binary image.
4. Find contours in the binary image using OpenCV's contour detection functions.
5. Draw the detected contours on the original image in red.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
